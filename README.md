Engrain Hack Night
------------------

This is a simple boilerplate for quickly getting up and running with Electron.

## Getting Started

Electron relies on tools which require the use of a command line interface
(CLI). If you are new to using a CLI, you can read the recommended 
[Windows](http://dosprompt.info/) or 
[Mac OSX](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line)
getting started guide. Additionally, you can google search "Windows command 
prompt getting started" or "Mac OSX terminal getting started" and will find many 
other guides and tutorials.

## Requirements

The only requirement is Node.js ([nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org)), which is a
JavaScript runtime environment. It is easily installed on Mac OSX/Linux/Windows
and install instructions can be [found here](http://nodejs.org/).

## Install

Download the codebase using either `git clone` for git users or with this
download link: https://github.com/engrain-io/event-hacknight-electron-boilerplate/archive/master.zip

Once downloaded, open a terminal (Linux/Mac OSX) or command prompt (Windows) and
`cd` into your project directory.

> **Note:** Your project directory is the directory this README file is located 
  within.

1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm start`

`npm install` will install the needed packages for Electron and `npm start` will
start the application!

## Building your application.

Open `index.html` in a code editor and remove the line
`Make something awesome!`. Next, quit the previous running application
(`Electron -> Quit`)and once again run `npm start` from your project directory.
Your application will rebuild and you should see your change. Rinse and repeat!
